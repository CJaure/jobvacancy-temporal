Feature: Billing
    Subscriptions are managed on monthly basis
    The bill should only include the amount to pay for the current period (no previous debts)
    For billing purposes, the minimum period to bill is half a month
    The billing statement should indicate the date of the next bill
    Subscription type changes are out of scope (for now)
